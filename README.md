# NFL Analysis Project - CSE 314 Final Project
## Gus, Ram, Hannah, Matt
The NFL is one of the most popular sports in America, and in all sports, there is always some people that are doing things "right" and doing some things "wrong", and we wanted to find out who. We decided to analyze different aspects of the NFL, from doing statistic efficiency analysis to figuring out how much a player should make based on their statistics. We have presented our project in a Dash application, with a tab for each of the 4 members.

## Installation
